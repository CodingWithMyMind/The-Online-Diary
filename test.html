    <p class="subtitle">Project Proposal
    </p>
    <img class="header" src="Images/header.jpg" alt="">
    <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
    <p>
        This website's purpose is to allow a user to log in or sign up to record their daily thoughts and emotions in an
        online diary. The user can do this by typing text about their day and using sliders to rate their emotions
        before saving, other information will also be added to each diary entry, such as the date, providing each entry
        with rich context to that particular day. The user can also re-read previous entries and also compare how the
        emotions change from day to day via a line graph. This website is also accessible on a wide variety of devices
        because it utilises responsive design practices.
    </p>
    <h1 id="productPurpose">Product purpose</h1>
    <h6>“If you try to sell to everyone, then you’ll end up selling to no-one.”</h6>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <h3>Diary user</h3>
    <p>
        Regular diary users could benefit a lot with the advantages of using a digital service instead of physical
        diaries, we aim to create value for these customers by solving the challenges faced with physical media such as;
        potentially losing your diary and information, it not being secure so anyone can read it and having to carry it
        around all the time. Our solution solves these issues saving all your entries, only you can read and write them
        and from any device!
    </p>
    <h3>People interested in their Emotional Wellbeing</h3>
    <p>
        People that are interested in their emotional wellbeing will also find this website very useful as the ability
        to record your emotions as well as see a graph of your emotions over time can be very insightful. This will
        bring value to this audience as it something they aim to improve on.
    </p>
    <h2>Justification of creativity</h2>
    <h3>Innovative approach to diary keeping</h3>


    <p>
        This approach of entwining the emotions of the day along with your general thoughts may not be that radical but
        to then see how these emotions change over time dynamically will hopefully prove to be something new,
        entertaining and insightful
    </p>
    <h3>Efficient Pragmatic design </h3>


    <p>
        The main features of this website will be presented clearly on the first page allowing us to get straight to
        what we want to do which is write in our diary, even if its in a hurry
    </p>
    <h3>Easy to use</h3>


    <p>
        This website will be easy to use in part due to the styling and lack of clutter, it will present the information
        clearly and precisely with an emphasis on the typography to draw the user to the main elements

    <h1 id="components">Vue Components in depth</h1>


    <p>
        <strong>Props</strong> - Props are the way of passing variables between components in vue.js. They’re read only
        and passed down the component tree. They can be of many data types and have default values. I will use props
        when the user wants to read a diary entry, the data must be passed into this diary entry via props.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Component Registration</strong> - When we define components we generally use camel case. Usually a
        component's scope is global but we can register it locally. When the scope is global it can be used in the
        template of any root Vue instance. If we make the component registration private then it can be left out of our
        final build meaning less js for the client to download, improving performance
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Enter/Leave & List Transitions</strong> - We can use transitions to make our page more visually
        appealing. These effects can be applied when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. This is
        useful as it will automatically apply the classes for the css transitions to our items.
    </p>
    <h1 id="systemsummary">Summary of how the web system will function</h1>

    <p>
        This website will be capable of the following functions:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>User authentication: User must log in or sign up first time so they can access their own diary entries
            securely

        <li>Create diary entry: user can write text into a text field and also change emotional slider then submit

        <li>View extra information: users will be presented with a quote of the and time and date automatically. If user
            agrees to share location data they will also be presented with weather information

        <li>View previous entries: user can look at previous entries made by themself

        <li>View emotional graph: user will be able to view a line graph of all current emotional scores
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The core functionality of the website is accessible from the dashboard after you log in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a user journey of the websites core functions
    </p>
 

        <img src="Images/flowchart.png" alt="">

    <p>
        Below is the hierarchy of components for the index page. As we can see a diary entry can be accessed from either
        the search.vue or previousEntries.vue. Diary entry must be the child component so we can pass information to it
        via props
    
    <p/>

    <h3>Feasibility</h3>


    <p>
        I believe although ambitious, this project proposal should serve as a template for how the site will be made. By
        prioritizing the user stories and aiming to complete 2 a week i should be on schedule.

                z.className += "mobile";
            } else {
                z.className = "navBar";
